theory,theory,5,(a) (i) Name two elements which make the teeth of mammals strong. (ii) Name two common diseases of the human teeth. (b) State three reasons why sandy soil cannot support effective plant growth. (c) An atom has 13 protons and 14 neutrons: (i) draw and label the structure of the atom. (ii) State its valency. (d) (i) State three ways in which fluid pressure is applied in everyday activities. (ii) State one substance that is an insulator. Show Solution (a) (i) Elements that make the teeth strong 1. Calcium 2. Flourine 3. Phosphorus (ii) Common diseases of the human teeth 1. Dental caries/cavity/tooth decay 2. Gum disease/gingivitis/periodontal disease 3. Cancer 4. Plague (b) Reasons why sandy soil cannot support effective plant growth 1. Cannot hold enough water/easy for water to filter out 2. Easily eroded 3. Heats up easily/ dries out easily 4. Poor in nutrient content/less fertile 5. Succeptible to leaching (c) (i) (ii) Valency = 3 (three) (d) (i) Ways in which fluid pressure is applied in everyday activities 1. Water pumps 2. Car brakes 3. Drinking straw 4. Pumping tyre 5. Syringes 6. Siphon 7. Enema (ii) Substances that are an insulators 1.Dry wood 2. Air 3. Rubber 4. Plastic 5. Glass 6.

theory,theory,6,(a) Explain the term mixed cropping . (b) (i) What is an alloy ? (ii) Name the constituent elements in brass. (c) (i) State three effects of dumping waste materials into water bodies. (ii) State one function of each of the following factors in photosynthesis: (α) chlorophyll; (β) water. (d) (i) What is work ? (ii) A block of wood of mass 10 kg was dragged through a distance of 3.2 m when a force of 20 N was applied. Calculate the work done. Show Solution (a) Mixed cropping A system of farming in which two or more crops are grown on the same piece of land at the same time/simultaneously (b) (i) Alloy An alloy is a uniform mixture of two or more metals or a metal and non-metal. (ii) Brass contains Copper and Zinc (c) (i) Effects of dumping waste materials into water bodies 1. Decompose to give the water bad odour 2. Introduces germs/diseases into the water 3. Reduces oxygen level in the water 4. Causes flooding 5. Makes water dirty/unsafe for drinking/pollutes water (ii) (α) Function of chlorophyll in photosynthesis Absorbs/traps sunlight/converts CO 2 and H 2 O into glucose (β) Function of water in photosynthesis Used to produce glucose/produces oxygen (d) (i) Work Work is said to be done when a force moves a body through a distance in the direction of the force (ii) Work = Force x Distance Force = 20 N Distance = 3.2 m Work done = 3.2 m x 20 N = 64 J,,
